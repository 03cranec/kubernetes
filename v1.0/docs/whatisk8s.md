# What is Kubernetes?

The Kubernetes project was started by Google in 2014. 

Kubernetes is an open-source platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers. It schedules containers across clusters of hosts.

With Kubernetes, you are able to quickly and efficiently respond to customer demand: 

 - Scale your applications on the fly
 - Seamlessly roll out new features
 - Optimize use of your hardware by using only the resources you need


#### Kubernetes is:

* **lean**: lightweight, simple, accessible
* **portable**: public, private, hybrid, multi-cloud
* **extensible**: modular, pluggable, hookable, composable
* **self-healing**: auto-placement, auto-restart, auto-replication

Kubernetes builds upon a [decade and a half of experience that Google has with running production workloads at scale](https://research.google.com/pubs/pub43438.html), combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.

#### Why containers?

* **Application-centric management**: Raising the level of abstraction from running an OS on virtual hardware to running an application on an OS using logical resources delivers the simplicity of PaaS with flexibility of IaaS -- you can run much more than just [12-factor apps](http://12factor.net/).
* **Dev and Ops separation of concerns**: Separation of build and deployment decouples applications from infrastructure.
* **Agile application creation and deployment**: It's easier and faster to create a container image to run your applications than using a VM image.
* **Continuous development, integration, and deployment**: Build and deploy application images many times a day, with fast and easy rollbacks (due to image immutability).
* **Loosely coupled, distributed, elastic, liberated [micro-services](http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html)**: Break applications into smaller pieces that can be deployed and managed independently and dynamically -- not a fat monolithic stack running on one big single-purpose machine.
* **Environmental consistency across development, testing, and production**: Runs the same on a laptop as it does in the cloud.
* **Cloud and OS distribution portability**: Run on Ubuntu or RHEL, on-prem, or Google Container Engine, which makes sense for build and test environments as well as for deployment.
* **Resource isolation**: Predictable application performance.
* **Resource utilization**: High efficiency and density.
